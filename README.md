Click [here](https://main.d15u68egeazevg.amplifyapp.com/) to access the website!

This project employs various `industry-standard technologies` such as:

* JS 
* HTML/CSS
* React
* Node
* Tailwind
* Three.js
* Email JS
* Vite

to build a personal porfolio website with a clean & modern UI and interactive `3D models`.

The website is complete with links to socials, my resume, email functionality, past experiences, tech stack, projects, and more.

## Previews :eyes:

`Note:` many visuals are interactive 3D models including but not limited to the pc set-up, tech stack balls, and the globe.


## Future Plans :crystal_ball:

While Armaan's World is currently being hosted using AWS Amplify, and using a generic domain, I am in the process of purchasing a custom domain and hosting elsewhere. Thus, the domain is subject to change.
